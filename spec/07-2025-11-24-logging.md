# Feature Request: Logging & Log Viewer

**Date:** 2025-11-24
**Status:** Planned

## Description
The user needs a way to view application logs to diagnose errors (e.g., connection failures) that might disappear too quickly from the UI notifications.

## Requirements
- **File Logging**:
  - Log all important events (INFO) and errors (ERROR) to a file named `amq_manager.log` in the current working directory (or user home).
  - Include timestamps and log levels.
- **Log Viewer UI**:
  - A new screen within the application to view the contents of the log file.
  - Auto-refresh or manual refresh to see new logs.
  - Scrollable view.

## UI/UX
- **Access**: Accessed via a hotkey (e.g., 'l') from the main Queue List.
- **Screen**: A simple text view displaying the log file content.
